Bash Cafe is a text-based business simulation game written in Bash where players run a coffee shop. Bash Cafe is losely based off the 1979 game "Lemonade Stand" for DOS.

Run in a unix shell. Change directory to _**/scripts**_ and run using:
`./bash_cafe.sh`

### How it Works
Players start with $100.

Every day, the players have to make 2 choices, how many coffees they want to make, and how much they will charge for them.
Then, the number of sales is calculated based off temperature and cost. The income is calculated and the profit is
calculated by subtracting the cost of making the coffee and running your store.

The goal of the game is to predict how many coffees your need to make and how much to charge based off the temperature outside
(since everyone loves AC when its hot out). As the days progress, your goal is to make as much money as possible.
